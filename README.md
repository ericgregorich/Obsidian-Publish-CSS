# Obsidian-Publish-CSS
My custom CSS for Obsidian Publish

I've had several requests about my "theme" for my Obsidan Publish site https://publish.obsidian.md/ericgregorich.
It is just some simple CSS that I've tweaked over time. 

Open the publish.css to see the CSS I use. Feel free to use it for your site.
